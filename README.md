# Domus Checker - Hackathon Styled Project
Domus is Edinburgh Uni's student letting service and provides accomodation for  second and subsequent year students.
Domus releases a batch of flats every week however these are incredibly competitive to get. 
Thus, we decided to create a program that would check for updates in the morning (we noticed they usually add new updates in the mornings) and send us a text if there was an update.
