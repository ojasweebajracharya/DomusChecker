# Domus Checker - Hackathon Styled Project
Domus is Edinburgh Uni's student letting service and provides accomodation for  second and subsequent year students.
Domus releases a batch of flats every week however these are _incredibly_ competitive to get (first come first serve) and theres no notification system already in place for when they update :(  
Thus, we decided to create a program that would check for updates in the morning and send us a text if there was an update.
(We noticed they usually add new updates in the mornings >.<)

We hope this little application will make it easier for us to find a flat in Edinburgh aaaaaaa.
